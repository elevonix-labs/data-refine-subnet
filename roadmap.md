**Phase 1: Subnet Design (Q3 2024)**

- **Subnet Nodes**: Establish and define the roles and functionalities of the subnet nodes involved in the dataset generation process.
- **Validation and Scoring Mechanism**: Design a robust system to assess the quality of datasets produced by miners, ensuring accuracy and reliability.
- **Task API**: Design an API for dataset task generation.

**Phase 2: Subnet Development (Q4 2024)**

- **Task API Development**: Design and deploy an API for efficient task retrieval and distribution, enabling miners to access and process tasks.
- **Implementation of Miner/Validator Functionalities**: Develop the essential functionalities for miners and validators to facilitate data processing and evaluation.
- **Dataset Quality Evaluation Module**: Create a module to assess dataset quality through model training and performance metrics.
- **Prototype Testing**: Conduct extensive testing to ensure the functionality and efficiency of the subnet before launch.
- **Reward Mechanism Deployment**: Implement a reward system to motivate miners and validators based on their performance.

**Phase 3: Website Development (Q4 2024)**

- **Subnet Overview Page**: Develop a detailed webpage that outlines the subnetâ€™s features, milestones, and advantages to attract and inform stakeholders.
- **Miner/Validator Leaderboard**: Establish an interactive leaderboard showcasing the performance and rankings of miners and validators, promoting transparency and competition.

**Phase 4: Subnet Launch (Q4 2024)**

- **Mainnet Deployment**: Launch the subnet on the mainnet with fully operational and stable systems.
- **Community Building and Onboarding**: Develop strategies to foster a strong community through educational resources, forums, and support mechanisms.

**Phase 5: Continuous Improvements (Q1 2025)**

- **Integration with Bittensor Subnet**: Initiate integration with existing Bittensor subnets to demonstrate subnet value and enhance cross-network operability (starting with SN9).
- **DataSource Expansion**: Diversify the data sources beyond CommonCrawl to include additional platforms.
- **Dataset Expansion**: Increase the token count and capabilities of datasets.
- **Growth to Multi-Modality**: Expand dataset types to include multi-modal data, thereby broadening the application scope of the subnet.
