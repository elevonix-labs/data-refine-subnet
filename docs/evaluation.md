# Scoring Function

This scoring function evaluates the quality of responses based on time efficiency, data quality, and sample similarity, while handling skipped responses and penalizing disqualified ones. The goal is to balance these factors and ensure the integrity of the system by preventing miners from submitting low-quality or overly similar responses to game the system.

## Steps to Calculate Score:

### 1. Skipped Responses
If a response is skipped, its score will be **2/3** of the previous score. This ensures that miners are still penalized for skipping responses, but the penalty is not as harsh as disqualification.

```python
if skipped:
    return previous_score * (2/3)
```

### 2. Similarity Threshold
This step is essential for preventing miners from cheating by submitting repeated or trivial variations of previous responses. The system checks the sample similarity scores for all submitted responses, which helps ensure that each new submission offers genuine value and is not simply copied or overly similar to previous ones.

- The function computes the similarity between the new response and previous samples.
- If **all** sample similarity scores are less than or equal to **70%**, the response is disqualified, and the score is set to zero.

This threshold ensures that responses aren't too dissimilar, which could indicate an attempt to bypass the system by submitting low-quality content. The threshold is designed to flag and disqualify responses that donâ€™t meet meaningful similarity criteria.

```python
if all(similarity <= 70 for similarity in sample_similarities):
    return 0
```

### 3. Data Quality
The data quality is calculated as the ratio between the provided `value` and the `stderr` (standard error), with a small constant added to avoid division by zero. This ensures that the accuracy and precision of the data are properly evaluated in the final score.

```python
data_quality = value / (stderr + 1e-8)
```

### 4. Time Efficiency and Weighting
The final score is a blend of the time efficiency and data quality, based on the parameter `x`. This parameter controls how much weight is assigned to time (efficiency) versus data quality. For example, setting `x` to a higher value gives more weight to time, while a lower value prioritizes data quality.

- **Time contributes** `x` of the score.
- **Data quality contributes** `(1 - x)` of the score.

```python
score = (time_elapsed * x) + (data_quality * (1 - x))
```

### 5. Final Output
The final score represents the overall performance, factoring in time efficiency, data quality, and any penalties for skipped or disqualified responses.

```python
return score
```
