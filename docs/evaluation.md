# Scoring Function

This system evaluates the quality of responses based on time efficiency, data quality, and sample similarity. It also handles skipped responses by assigning them a score that is **2/3** of the previous score. The overall score is computed by balancing these factors while penalizing responses that don't meet similarity thresholds.

## Steps to Calculate Score:

### 1. Skipped Responses
If the response is marked as skipped, the score will be **2/3** of the previous score.

```python
if skipped:
    return previous_score * (2/3)
```

### 2. Similarity Threshold
The function checks if all sample similarity scores are less than or equal to 70%. If this condition holds true, the response is disqualified, and the score is set to zero.

```python
if all(similarity <= 70 for similarity in sample_similarities):
    return 0
```

### 3. Data Quality
The data quality is calculated as a ratio between the provided `value` and `stderr` (standard error), with a small constant added to avoid division by zero errors.

```python
data_quality = value / (stderr + 1e-8)
```

### 4. Time Efficiency and Weighting
The final score is computed by blending the elapsed time (`time_elapsed`) and data quality. This blend is controlled by the parameter `x`, which determines how much weight is given to time (efficiency) vs. data quality. The score is a weighted sum:

- Time contributes `x` of the score.
- Data quality contributes `(1 - x)` of the score.

```python
score = (time_elapsed * x) + (data_quality * (1 - x))
```

### 5. Final Output
The resulting score is then returned, representing the balance between the timeliness of the response, the accuracy of the data, and handling skipped or disqualified responses.

```python
return score
```
